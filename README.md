# Optimization
My old program, that finds an approximating function based on given data.
This was made at my work to calculate the length of ultrasonic waveguides to fit the resonans frequency of ultrasonic welding tool. It calculates linear and exponential functions and desides which does the best job. Also it makes useless logs (becouse why not?) and saves data in .txt file.
